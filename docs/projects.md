## Here are some projects that I have worked on:


### [The Future of the Boulder Public Library District](https://medium.com/@roha8848/the-future-of-the-boulder-public-library-district-6633f06a5399)

An exploration of data from Colorado's [Library Research Service](https://www.lrs.org/) to predict how funding for Boulder's newly established library district would change based on other Colorado library districts and municipal library systems.

### [An Ethnographic Investigation of Informatics at the Boulder Public Library Main Branch](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPh_eKjI=/?share_link_id=489305851683)

Using ethnographic observation and inductive thematic analysis we collected data about the informatics of the Boulder Public Library and formulated design recommendations to reduce information frictions.
